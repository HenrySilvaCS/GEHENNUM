## What am I?
I am an A.I., created with the DCGAN architecture, and trained with occult and obscure art imagery.
## What is my purpose ?
To generate nightmarish and dark images.
## What is this repository?
This repository will contain the source code for the model.
## Using the model
```python

```

## Info
The model was trained using a DCGAN architecture for 64x64 image generation. I used the [best artworks of all time dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time), together with a 4000 image dataset scraped from pinterest, consisting of occult and dark imagery. These images will become available soon.

The model will soon be trained on a 256x256 architecture.
